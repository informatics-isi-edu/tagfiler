$def with (target, taginfo, urlquote)
$# the following nonsense line is due to a bug in the template engine... don't know why it works but it does!
$for foo in [ 0 ]:
$code
	def rendertagvals(filetagvals):
		s = ""
		for file, tag, vals in filetagvals:
			for val in vals:
				s += target + "/tags/" + urlquote(file) + "/" + urlquote(tag) + "/" + urlquote(val) + "\n"
		return s
${rendertagvals(taginfo[4])[:-1]}
